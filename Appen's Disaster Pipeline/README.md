## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All necesary libraries are indicated at the beginning of each notebook, feel free to explore the project. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

1. Run the following command in the project's root directory (*src/app*) to run your web app.
     - `python run.py`

2. Go to http://10.5.0.2:3001

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025), I needed to develop a project following these [steps](https://github.com/JoseEstevan/DS-Experiments/blob/main/Appen's%20Disaster%20Pipeline/Steps.md).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The project is divided into 3 files, the data file contain all the data needed to run the project.
The notebooks file contains the notebooks that will be used to run the project before developing the application. The src file contains the application code along with the python pipeline needed to run the project.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

I developed a machine learning pipeline in this project to assign labels to events and notify aid organizations.

The goal of my project was to create a web app where emergency personnel may enter messages and get classification results. Information is visualized in the software.
