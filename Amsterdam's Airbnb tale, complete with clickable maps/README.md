## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All necesary libraries are indicated at the beggining of the [notebook]().  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/QWDCRB9GLLYL), i needed to develop a project following this [steps]().

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I published a [post in my Medium](), a more detailed report can be found on the notebook [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JoseEstevan/DS-Experiments/42811bf5909f85e8a5b902d1508df616b0d46f79). 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

This research endeavors to supply a simple method for considering relevant data while making decisions.
I highlight some ideas that may be more helpful than simply drafting a pros and cons list the next time a significant decision must be made.
Although it does not provide a step-by-step guide to finding the ideal location, it does offer advice on how to use logic.
