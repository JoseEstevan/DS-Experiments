## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All necesary libraries are indicated at the beggining of the [notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JoseEstevan/DS-Experiments/42811bf5909f85e8a5b902d1508df616b0d46f79).  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025), I needed to develop a project following these [steps](https://github.com/JoseEstevan/DS-Experiments/blob/main/Amsterdam's%20Airbnb%20tale%2C%20complete%20with%20clickable%20maps/Steps.md).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I published a [post in my Medium](https://joseestevan.medium.com/amsterdams-airbnb-tale-complete-with-clickable-maps-17d858cc8003), a more detailed report can be found on the notebook [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JoseEstevan/DS-Experiments/42811bf5909f85e8a5b902d1508df616b0d46f79). 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

This research endeavors to supply a simple method for considering relevant data while making decisions.
I highlight some ideas that may be more helpful than simply drafting a pros and cons list the next time a significant decision must be made.
Although it does not provide a step-by-step guide to finding the ideal location, it does offer advice on how to use logic.
